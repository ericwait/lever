# **LEVER**
### The Lineage Editing and Validation tool

LEVER (lineage editing and validation) is a set of software tools for analyzing 
time-lapse microscopy images of proliferating cells. LEVER includes algorithms for 
segmenting, tracking and lineaging. LEVER also includes a novel validation 
interface that makes any errors in the automated results easy to identify and quick
to correct.
