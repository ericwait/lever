## **How to Use**

#### **File Naming**
Users must run LEVer on a set of Tiffs named using the convention {Experiment Indenfier}_c{channel number}_t{frame number}_z{z value}.

Example SZV_c02_t0034_Z0001 for the second channel, 34th frame and 1 image of the SZV experment image stack.

## **Key Features**
#### **Implimentation of Segmentation Algorithms**
